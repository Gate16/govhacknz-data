# Data made available especially for GovHack

There's a lot of open government data already available, see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n7pddL_Gn3MH1jOcWSRiggf9aL1aAUHM4XbimJ8xGaE/)

Some very special people have made data available especially for GovHack, and you can access these sources in the folders above:
- [Generosity New Zealand](http://generosity.org.nz/) is facilitating a thriving generosity ecosystem. They administer grants for organisations looking to make a difference, and have provided data on the products they administer.
- Inland Revenue have made available some data on donations, split by Territorial Authority (TA)
- Ministry of Social Development have provided the contract-level data from their [Contract Mapping website](http://www.contractmapping.govt.nz/). It is available as a zipped PostgreSQL database dump (depends on PostGis), and as a series of CSV files (one per database table, without geography)
- Wellington City Council have provided an extract from the WCC rating database displaying property attributes for rateable parcels
